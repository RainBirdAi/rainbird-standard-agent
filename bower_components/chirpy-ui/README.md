#  Rainbird Chirpy-UI

### Rainbird Chirpy-UI is a chat styled agent.

If you're using this repo as a starting point for your own UI implementation you'll need to change the call to
getAgentConfig as this call isn't supported across origin. Instead simply use the rapi.start() function refering to the
Rainbird API documentation for further details.
